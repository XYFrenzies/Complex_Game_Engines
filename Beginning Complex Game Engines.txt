Scripts Needed:

RoundBasedSystem: Creates the main round based system for the mainframe of the game. If theres more than 2 characters, the player can 

Entities: Needs to be modular so that it has a health bar (customisable) and level (min level 1 and max level 100).
Multiple players can be added to the game.

Items: A list of items that can be used within the game.

Movesets: A array of different moves that can be used by the player and AI.

BattleHUD: 

Status Effects:

Types and Resistences:

Stats:


Game Manager:

Primary stats:(Cant be less than one)(default a primary stat)
[Array of stat names][Array of stat integers][Whether its a percentage or integer]

Secondary stats:(Cant be less than one)(default a secondary stat)
[Array of stat names][Array of stat integers]

Secondary stats:
[What influences its damage (primary or secondary) + original "Can have more than one influencing it"]

Status Effects in game:
[Array of status effect names][Status effect value as a integer or percentage][What it effects (secondary or primary in a positive or negative way)]

Types and or Resistences In Game:
[Array of Type name][Whether it is an amour resistence or type chart (or both "This equation will have to be looked into")]

Typing weak and strong and immune:
[What each type is strong to and weak to and what is immune to (can all be none and just be neutral damage)]

Items available:
[Item names][Value of the item][Percentage or Integer]
[Benefits of the item (can be none these can be for the enemy or the player)][Benefits against the item (can be none these can be for the enemy or player)]
(These can use status effects)

Movesets:
[Name]
[Type of each move (if there isnt a type, make it neutral)]
[Desription]
[Power] - When determining the power and strength of the move, if the move is the same type as the player, it will increase the power of the move.
[Accuracy]
[Can it hit multiple targets]


Entities:
[Number of Entities in Scene]
Each Entity:

[Type or resistence that they have]
[Movesets they have]
[Health]
[Level][Influenced value and effort value points (EV and IV's)]
[Primary Stats][How the level influences the stats]
[Secondary Stats][How the level influences the stats]

(Use pokemons determination of stats to find the inflences of stats over levels)
Algorithm:
((Original stats + influences values) x 2 + rounded value of(root of effort values / 4) x Level) (this is all rounded to the nearest full number) + 5




Status effects:

When attacking the equation will be:
Strength or Special Attack (% or +) / Defense or Special Defense * (level + 2)/5 * Type advantage * status inflicted (if you are weakened by a status).

v
(((((2 x Level) / 5) + 2) x Power of attack x Attack (attack or special attack) / Defense or sp defense) / 50) x Type x if its the same type x status inflicted (if its a weakened status)
